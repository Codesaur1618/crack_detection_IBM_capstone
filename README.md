## Background
Crack detection in infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and bridges is crucial for ensuring safety and structural integrity. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to automatically identify cracks in images, aiding in proactive maintenance and inspection.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crack-detection.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd crack-detection
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the [Training](#training) section to train the models.
3. Use the trained models for crack detection by following the guidelines in the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the crack detection models consists of a collection of annotated images containing both cracked and non-cracked surfaces. Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset cannot be provided directly with this repository. However, you can obtain similar datasets from public repositories or contact the project contributors for guidance on obtaining datasets.

## Training
### PyTorch Model
To train the PyTorch-based ResNet50 model, run the following command:

```plaintext
python train_pytorch.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset
```
## Evaluation
After training the models, you can evaluate their performance using the test set. Run the evaluation script as follows:

```plaintext
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model --test_dataset /path/to/test_dataset
```
## Results
The results of model evaluation, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, will be displayed upon running the evaluation script. Additionally, sample visualizations of crack detection results may be provided in this section.
